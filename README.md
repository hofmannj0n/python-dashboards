# Bee Populations and Twitter Likes Dashboards

Welcome to the Bee Populations and Twitter Likes Dashboards repository! This project contains two interactive Dash dashboards created using Python: one visualizes bee populations affected by Varroa mites, and the other displays the Twitter likes of famous people over time.

## Bee Populations Dashboard

The Bee Populations Dashboard presents data on bee populations impacted by Varroa mites across different states in the USA. Users can select a year from the dropdown menu to view the percentage of bee colonies affected by Varroa mites for that specific year.
